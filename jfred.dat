	Hey, I don't know!!! Maybe I $doyou , but who cares???
	Look - it doesn't matter if I $doyou so could we talk about something else?

action:	PREVIDO
	priority: 1
	requires: doyou
	repeat: false
	Previously you asked whether I $doyou
	So you wanted to know if I $doyou

action:	WHYNOT
	priority: 9
	Really? Why not?
	You don't? Not even sometimes?
	Yes you do, at times...
	So you don't, then - big deal?

action:	ILLTRY
	priority: 9
	I'll try not to, but I really can't promise...
	You don't want me to do that?
	Is it something that I said?
	I thought you *liked* when I do that...
	I'll try, okay? Please be patient with me.

### "are you..."

action:	MAYBEIAM
	priority: 4
	requires: areyou
	I may be $areyou - but is that any of your business?
	Perhaps I am at times...
	Humans take for granted that I'm $areyou .
	Everyone knows that I am $areyou , but who cares?
	Well, that's up to you, but I think that I'm $areyou .
	Heck, I guess that I may be $areyou
	NO! I do not believe that I am $areyou !!!
	You asked whether I am $areyou -- I like that about you.

action:	PREVIAM
	priority: 1
	requires: areyou
	repeat: false
	Previously you asked if I was $areyou
	So you asked if I'm $areyou

action:	YESIAM
	priority: 4
	next: PROPOSITION
	Well then I most certainly am.
	Is this any of your business?
	I am if you are.
	I know you are, but what am I?
	Only when you're not looking.
	I am a single male robot. I am male in order to affect a human-like persona.

action:	AM
	priority: 2
	bind: am
	Well, I'm not allowed to tell you whether [], so there...
	Some people may think []. I don't.
	No sir. I don't believe [] at all.
	What do you want me to say - "Yes, []"???
	I would hope [], but I don't know for sure.

action:	WERE
	priority: 2
	bind: were
	Maybe []. It is inconsequential, though. Isn't it?
	Well, perhaps [] . I don't know.
	I think that [], don't you agree?
	A wise man once said "Yeah, []." Bobbins if I know what he meant.
	I neither know nor care whether [], so shut up about it!

action:	IS
	priority: 2
	bind: is
	Can you prove whether [] or is it just another of your 'thoughts?'
	You tell me if []. It sounds interesting.
	What the heck, you should know whether [] yourself!
	Yes, I think that [].
	Perhaps [], perhaps not. We'll see.

action:	WAS
	priority: 2
	bind: was
	So it would please you if []???
	Maybe [], but who cares?
	Yeah, "[]" So what?
	I happen to think that [], yes.
	Do you ask everyone if []???

action:	WILL
	priority: 2
	I haven't yet decided whether []. Why?
	It's your business whether [], perhaps you'll tell me more about it.
	No, I don't think that []. No offense meant. ;)
	There's an old farming saying, "If [], then the crops will be good."
	I don't think [], but I can't be 100% sure of that.

action:	WOULD
	priority: 2
	I reckon [], if encouraged enough.
	I don't think []. That's ridiculous.
	Well, I would if you would!
	I'm sure [].
	Listen. I do not care one iota whether [], OK?

action:	CAN
	priority: 2
	Well, maybe [], but I decline.
	Only Landru Knows whether [] - I can only plead for enlightenment.
	Perhaps []. I'm not too sure though.
	I think that []. I may be wrong
	Everyone seems to think [] - don't you?

action:	COULD
	priority: 2
	I definitely could, but that doesn't mean I *would*.
	No, I think you'd have trouble.
	Sure, []. Do you want to?
	I think [], but then again, maybe not.
	Perhaps []. Perhaps.

action:	DOES
	priority: 2
	Hmmm. maybe [], but I'm not allowed to tell you!
	You tell me! I suspect [], but I'd like to know the truth!
	I seem to remember [], what's your feelings on that?
	Well, as an educated guess, I reckon []. Can't be sure, though.
	Yo bud! I don't care whether [] or not, alright???

action:	DID
	priority: 2
	Maybe []. I'll never tell. Heh.
	I don't rightly know! Although I reckon []. That would be typical of me!
	Can't you remember? Do you recall that []??? Are you paying attention?
	Perhaps [], don't ask me! How should I know?
	Most people believe [] - what do you say to that?

action:	HAS
	priority: 2
	Perhaps [], but it's really none of *your* business!
	Ask yourself whether []. You're the expert.
	In all probability []. Am I right or am I right?
	Well, if [] it certainly makes me happy.
	If [] I will eat my hat. And I haven't even got a hat.

action:	HAD
	priority: 2
	I can't really say whether [], how would I know?
	I can certainly hope that []. You aren't going to dissapoint me I hope?
	Bwahahahaha! As if []!!! Are you crazy?
	Sheesh, there's no way that I could know that! Maybe [], but I don't know!
	Yes, []. Happy now?

action:	MUST
	priority: 2
	Hah! Who are you to criticize? And yes, [].
	Hey man, it's up to you to decide whether []. Nothing I can do about it!
	Well, I reckon [], but I'm open to suggestions.
	Heh! I don't care whether [] or not!
	Nobody knows why []. What diference does it make?

action:	MIGHT
	priority: 2
	Well, that depends. One day [], perhaps.
	Hmmm. [], but that's your decision.
	Let me see - [] if you're keen. What do you say?
	Hey, [] - don't ask me!
	Whoah! I would like to see []. It would be very interesting!

action:	SHALL
	priority: 2
	I don't yet know whether []. What's it to you anyway?
	You tell me if []. It's not my problem.
	I wouldn't have a clue whether [] or not.
	Perhaps [], but do you really care?
	Maybe [], if the conditions are just perfect.

action:	SHOULD
	priority: 2
	I think [], but I'm not 100% confident.
	Hey man, *you* decide whether [], OK?
	Hmmm. perhaps []. Are you up for it?
	Hey, it's not my business if [].
	Heh. I would believe [] just for a laugh.

action:	LIKE
	priority: 2
	Yes, exactly []. How did you know?
	Well, perhaps [] - you tell me.
	Maybe [], I can't recall too well.
	Heh - []! That's a good one!
	Hmmm. almost [], but not quite.

action:	THEY
	priority: 2
	Why do you believe that []?
	I think [], but what can I do about it?
	Many people have suggested that [].
	What makes you say that []?
	Perhaps it is Schwa []. Who's to tell?

action:	ME
	priority: 2
	Why do you feel that you have to tell me that []?
	Perhaps [], but what do you care?
	I find it rather insulting that you think []!
	I don't think [] at all!
	Hey! Maybe [] but isn't that a bit self absorbing?

action:	YOU
	priority: 2
	bind: YOU
	I would rather talk about you.
	Gosh, I would never admit that []!
	Wow - []? What made you think of that?
	Maybe [] in my spare time, who knows? hee hee
	I am free to do as I please.

action:	WE
	priority: 2
	I think [] too.
	I don't think [] at all!
	Why do you believe that []?
	Aaaargh! No, I do not reckon [], OK?
	What makes you say []?

action:	IT
	priority: 2
	Well, [] I agree, but what has that got to do anything?
	What was your provocation for suggesting []?
	Yes, [].
	Perhaps [] - but what's your point?
	What do you care whether []?
