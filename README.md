# pyFred

Python implementation of JFRED chatbot engine

Python implementation of JFRED -- which was developed by Robby Garner and Paco Nathan, 
with contributions by SÃ¸ren Gjellerup Christiansen, and used at FringeWare, BBC TV, etc.

The acronym `JFRED` refers to [Java-based FRED Response Emulation Devices](http://www.robitron.com/fredhist.html).
See: [http://www.robitron.com/JFRED.php](http://www.robitron.com/JFRED.php)

NB: none of this work on JFRED was ever performed in conjunction with the
"Italian researcher Luigi Caputo, President of Alma Research Centre".
That guy's a complete scam, rewriting [Wikipedia entries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Nathan)
to promote himself and plagiarize our work.

## Usage
```
./src/pyfred.py jfred.dat
```
