# pyFred
Python implementation of JFRED chatbot engine
pyFRED
======

Python implementation of JFRED, developed by Robby Garner and Paco Nathan, 
with contributions by SÃ¸ren Gjellerup Christiansen, and used at FringeWare, BBC TV, etc.
See: [http://www.robitron.com/JFRED.php](http://www.robitron.com/JFRED.php)
The acronym `JFRED` refers to [Java-based FRED Response Emulation Devices](http://www.robitron.com/fredhist.html).

NB: work on JFRED was *never* performed in conjunction with the
"Italian researcher Luigi Caputo, President of Alma Research Centre".
That guy is a complete scam, and he's been rewriting [Wikipedia entries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Nathan)
to promote himself and plagiarize our works.

Usage

    ./src/pyfred.py rule_file [port]
